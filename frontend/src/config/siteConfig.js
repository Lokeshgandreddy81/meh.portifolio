  // ===== ABOUT SECTIONS =====
  aboutSections: [
    {
      title: "I started in the engine room",
      description: "Backend systems, cloud architecture, and the gritty details of what makes systems reliable at scale. My degree in Computer Science was just the preface. The real learning began in production."
    },
    {
      title: "But my true passion isn't just building — it's architecting",
      description: "I believe the most elegant systems are invisible. They don't demand attention; they enable momentum."
    },
    {
      title: "I built an open-source framework for multi-agent automation",
      description: "Because I believe the future of work is collaborative — between humans and AI, not one replacing the other. It's a toolkit for orchestrating intelligence.",

      title: "I guide engineers transitioning into AI systems roles",

    },
    {
      title: "Beyond AI systems, I'm drawn to tools that amplify human creativity",
      description: "Open-source as a form of technical citizenship. Education that adapts, not just instructs. Architecture that lasts longer than trends. This is where engineering meets ethos."
    },
    {
      title: "I'm designing an autonomous business engine",
      description: "A system that observes, decides, and acts within complex workflows. Think of it as a co-pilot for operations, not automation for automation's sake."
    },
    {
      title: "Outside the terminal, I'm a student of systems thinking",
      description: "In code, in teams, in how ideas spread. I write to clarify my own thinking, speak to sharpen it, and listen to broaden it."
    },
    {
      title: "I speak at meetups about the craft of production-ready AI",
      description: "Because great engineering is as much about communication as it is about code. Sharing knowledge isn't just giving back — it's how we all move forward."
